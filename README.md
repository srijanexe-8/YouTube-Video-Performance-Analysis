# 📊 YouTube Video Performance Analysis

📺 *Unlocking secrets behind what makes a YouTube video successful using real data and machine learning.*

## 🔍 Overview

This project analyzes YouTube video performance data to discover what drives revenue, engagement, and audience retention. Using real-world data and Python, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and build a predictive model to estimate revenue based on key metrics.

## 🤖 Model Summary

We use a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict `Estimated Revenue (USD)` based on key engagement and audience metrics.

### 📏 Model Performance

| Metric               | Score  |
|----------------------|--------|
| Mean Squared Error   | ~0.45  |
| R² Score             | ~0.89  |

### 🧪 Sample Training Code

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

## 🚀 Model Enhancements & Advanced Evaluation

After building a basic Random Forest model, we improved performance through several advanced techniques:

### 🧠 Feature Engineering
- Added normalized engagement metrics like:
  - `Likes per View`
  - `Shares per View`
  - `New Comments per View`
- Extracted **publish hour** and **day of week** from timestamps
- Created an `Engagement Level` feature using quartile bins

### 🎯 Hyperparameter Tuning (Grid Search)
- Tuned `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, and `min_samples_leaf`
- Used `GridSearchCV` with 5-fold cross-validation to find optimal values

### ⚔️ Model Comparison
We trained and compared multiple models:
- **Random Forest Regressor (Tuned)**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**

#### 📊 Comparison Results (Sample)

| Model                    | R² Score | MSE    |
|--------------------------|----------|--------|
| Random Forest (Tuned)    | ~0.91    | ~0.41  |
| Gradient Boosting        | ~0.89    | ~0.44  |
| XGBoost                  | ~0.90    | ~0.42  |

### 🔁 Cross-Validation
Used 5-fold cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well and isn't overfitting:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, scoring='r2')
```

### 💾 Final Model Export
Saved the best-performing model using `joblib`:
```python
joblib.dump(model, "best_youtube_revenue_model.pkl")
```

> 📌 These enhancements significantly improved the model’s accuracy, robustness, and interpretability — turning the basic regressor into a more production-ready pipeline.
